              My name is Askar. I was born in a fall of 1991 in an election day
              of our first president. It was the time when USSR collapsed and we
              suddenly became an independent country. I think, my parents were
              really excited about that, they decided to name me after the first
              president Askar Akaev. So the name “Askar” was a good name till
              2005. Because in 2005 there was a revolution and our first
              president escaped to Russia. Since then probably people dont give
              this name to their children. Briefly about my life before
              immigration to USA. I went to Turkish high school. I graduated
              from highschool with all “A”s. After I studied finance in a
              university. And a little after graduating, I came to US.
