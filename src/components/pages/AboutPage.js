              My name is Askar. I was born in a fall of 1991 in an election day
              of our first president. It was the time when USSR collapsed and we
              suddenly became an independent country. I think, my parents were
              really excited about that, they decided to name me after the first
              president Askar Akaev. So the name “Askar” was a good name till
              2005. Because in 2005 there was a revolution and our first
              president escaped to Russia. Since then probably people dont give
              this name to their children.

              Briefly about my life before immigration to USA. I went to Turkish
              high school. I graduated from highschool with all “A”s. After I
              studied finance in the National university. And a little after
              graduating, I came to US.

            <h3>Taxi driver in Chicago...</h3>
            <p className="mb-0 text-dark">
              I started working as a taxi driver in Chicago. Believe it or not,
              I never drove a car before a taxi. So imagine passing the taxi
              written exam and driving exam. I used to take a blue line train to
              Olive Harvey city college, where I studied for the taxi license.
              Train used to take 2 hours one way, with changing blue to red line
              in downtown. FYI: to pass the exam, you need to memorize all the
              streets in Chicago, Points of interest, rules and regulations etc.
              Me being from a small village, it was a big challenge. But with
              perseverence, consistency and hard work I got my license from the
              second try. I was one answer short in the first try.
              <br />
              In my first day shift, I gave all my rides for free, because
              learning from a book and actual driving was waaaaay different. So
              I used to ask for direction, and people were nice. I am very
              thankful for those wonderful people for giving encouragement. I
              believe, as a stranger the best thing you can do is encourage
              people.I remember one of my customers words: "You did a great job,
              my young friend. You will be OK, dont worry" and gave me 20$ tip.
              And this is just one of many who said a lot of nice words. One
              interesting thing in the taxi, is you meet a lot of different
              people. So I decided to ask for advice from my passengers.
              Everytime I asked for advice, I asked for business card. I
              collected business cards in my notebook and wrote their stories
              and advices. Here are some of them:

            <p className="mb-0 text-dark">
              As a personal banker I learnt the essence of the customer service.
              I really enjoyed working with my colleagues. I learnt a lot of new
              things and met wonderful people.
